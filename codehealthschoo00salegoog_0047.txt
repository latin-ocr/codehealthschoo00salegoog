38 Introductury.

scholarly researclr like this would have afforded rne su·
preme gratification‚ Iarn persuaded that the text followed
by nre in the present edition is entirely orthodox, being
founded upon that of Zaccharias Sylvius, published at
Rotterdarn, 1657¹-an edition which includes Villa Nova’s
’ text and cornrnentary entire, and hasbeen pronounced the
cdri‘r'o recepta of modern times. Diligently comparing its
text with that of Sir Alexander Croke, published at Oxford ,
in 1830, and the later revised text published at Paris in
1861 (being an extract frorn the many volurnes of Salernian
writings collected by Drs. Daremberg and Renzi)‚1cnn
but think that I bave obtained as near a fac-sirnile of the
original Poern addressed to Duke Robert of Nornrnndy as
can be reproduced. In doing this, Ι have not ventured to
' make any fresh corrections, where even repetitions of the
same rule occurred superfluously, or clauses seemed paren·
thetically intruded into texts already sufficiently clear.
For, although these might justly be suspected of having a
different paternity from the original, yet they have stood

· so long the rnerciless inquest of critics, that it has seenred

to me their title to remain there was nrade good and inde-
leasible by prescription. Five hundred years of undisputed
occupancy are a title to possession such as few things can
show 3 and since there is no historical evidence against the
validity of that title, the presunrption naturally follows
that their right is an established one,

Besides reproducing the entire text of Villa Nova's
edition, Ι have annexed to the various sections such addi-
