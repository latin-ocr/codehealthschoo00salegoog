H EESE naturally is both cold and eloying,
Heavy and crude, and to digest annoyingf
Yet those in health their hunger ean appease‚
With nothing better than plain bread and cheese.
But poor dyspeptics ever must beware,
How they mix bread with this deceitsul sare.

Α Soliloquy, by Clzeese.

Kuow-nothing Doctors spcak of me as ill,
'though what the hanu Ι do they know not still.
'Tis rare Ι injure wiser oneS, who link

Me, fiuy, to good sood or congruous drink.

A languid steinach is by eheese o'ertaxed;

’Tis good before our meals is one’s relaxed3

If costive‚ then the feast with cheese dismi55‚
For doctors all are well agreed on this.

(Addztion srom Paris Ed„ 1861.)

Let cheese be sood whenever you begin

Your meal, but aster that be medicine.

Let eheese and duinty mushrooms ost unite Ἴ
To furnish you with a delicious bite.

Cheese is a wholesome dish in any land,

When e’er dispensed by an unlavish hand. ’
Cheese is a surly and capricious els,

Digesting every substance but itsels.
