AT not again 1111 thou dost certain feel

Thy stomach sreed 01 all its previous meal.

HE luscious peach, the apple and the pear,
Cheese‚ ven’son‚ salted meats and e’en the hare,
With sscsh 01 goats, dyspeptic throes provoke,
And crush the weak 'neath melancholy’s yoke.

(Addition 110111 Paris Ed„ 1861.)

Salt is the ssesh 01 ruffled ducks and geese;

Fried ments do harm; while boiled give peptic peace 3
And fragrant roastS, digestive powers increase.

Bitters will purge-crude things in all cause wind,
And salted ments the body dry and bind,

While crusts give rise to bile 01 darhest kind.

Snlt things consume virility and sight,

Α1111 psoric torments bteed 01 direst might.
