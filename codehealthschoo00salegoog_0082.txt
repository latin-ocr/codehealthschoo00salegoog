vlf milk fut nonsummnn.

OnTs’ milk and camels'‚ as by all is known,
Relievc poor mortals in consumption thrown;
While asses' milk is deemed sar more nntritious,
And, e’en beyond all cows' or sheeps’, officione.
But should a sever in the system riot,
Or headache‚ let the patient shun this diet„

(Adciition sronn Paris En, 1861.)

The stomach’s gently soothed‚ and moistened too,
The liver nonrished with fresh heat anew;

Tne loins more active are, the sat’s dispelled,

T hc bowels freed, and every taint expelled.

Cows’ milk gives wonted heat to every part,

And quickly dissipates the acrid smart

Os tainted humors‚with a soothing art;

increases llesh, to pangs ol womb gives ease,
Can moist the body, and its heat appense;
And whatsoever things remain still crude
within, converts to salutary sood.
