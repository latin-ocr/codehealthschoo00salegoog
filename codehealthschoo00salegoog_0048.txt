Intronlactory. 39

tious as are embodied in his own commentary, as also
further ones derived from the Paris edition of 1861. For,
although its editor, Dr. Daremberg, in common with all
students of the Schola Salernitana, is of opinion that its
text was originally limited to the subiect of Dietetics‚ as
shown in Villa Nova, he has nevertheless collected in his
edition of 1861 many desultory writings of the Salernian
Masters, upon various topics belonging to Medicine. From
these I have made such a selection as was deemed sufficient
to exlribit the views os those writers upon topics of general
interest, in aud out of the profession. These excerpts will
be found collected and arranged in the form of an Ae-
Psnnrx.

The original Poem contains three hundred and sixty-two
lines. Villa Nova’s additions and those of the Paris edi-
tiou os 1861, ns nunexed by me to the various sections,
give one hundred and twenty-one more, and the Appendix
itself contains two hundred and sixtyone, making a total
of seven hundred and forty-four lines. I have been stu-
dious to keep these additions separate from the original
text, and wherever they occur their origin is duly stated.
Iu preserving the separate sections with their appropriate
titles, I have carefully followed the erlino recepta, diflering
in this respect from Croke, who prints it as a continuous
poem, and Daremberg, who interpolates many passages
not found in Sylvius. All these, as appeared to me most
proper, being foreign matter of questionable authenticity‚
I have transferred to the Appendix.

The topics discussed in the Poem relate to the six non·

aar, fraud, exarct‘se, eleas), extrahens and the perstans, and
they are all introduced· as texts (afterward enlarged upon)
