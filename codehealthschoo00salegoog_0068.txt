IPE, good old wine imparts a richer blood
To him who daily tastes its tonic ilood;
But when too dark—bewarel the ‘danger's great
· That you may grow inert, and not elate.
Let wines be fine and clear, mature and old, ·-
And mixed with water, still, their sparkle lrold;
Then quali a mod'rate draught, secure and bold. ·

(Addition lrom Paris Ed, 1861.)

Bright beuds, when rising last in any wine,

Bespeak good quality aud vinage fine3

But sparkling wine, unless its tide flows free,

Is salse and doubly base in quality.

In good wine beads and bubbles take their start,
Resilient ever lrorn the central part.

In wines depravcd and drugged the bubbles spring,
From out, alone, the margin’s narrow ring. ¹ -

Ο aeid teste should lurk in wholesome beer;
Brewed srom sound grain, it should be old and
clear.
Lot not the stomach ever burdened be,
By long potations, unrestrained and sree.
