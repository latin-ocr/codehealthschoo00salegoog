And all things bloom at earth’s awalrening.

HEN May has corne, just purge yoursell at will,

Be bled, and take os sumptuous baths your fill;
Let spicy balsams through them be diffused,

And wormwood lotions also srecly used.
Whatevcr things are choscu then lor lood,

Eat lettuce leaves and drlnk from nature‘s pool.
