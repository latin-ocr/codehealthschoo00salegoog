Introductory.

“Dux Normannorumcuhctornm norma bonorum,
Rollo serus fortis, quem gens Normannica mortis
Invocat articulo hoc jacet in tumulo.‘'

And, again, in an epitaph on the duke of Sicily:

“linquens terrenas migravit Dux ad amoeuas
Rogerius sedes, nam Coeli detinet aedes.’'

The Leonine verse admitted os many varieties, based
upon either a hexameter or a pentameter. The former
admitted oi thirty-four lorms, the latter of only sont.
. The situation os the rhymes also varied in many ways:

rst. Whether at the end os the lines, thus producing the

Sunt Medici, per quos regnat Medicina Salemi.”

ad. thther in the middle, the line being divided into
two rhyming parts, these constituted the stinplices Leom‘ni,
and are the ones commonly used in the Schola Salernitana,
although its verses often fluctuate between the first and
second classes.

Os the simplices Leom'm' the following are illustratione:

Mane igitur montes, snb serum inquirite lontes.”

Some early bard has attempted it not unsuccesssully

For many a man’s soul bring γι, ad poenas inlernorum. ,x

When fiends tell first from Ilenvcn, qub pribs habitabant, 'l
On earth they leil the sins seven, et iratres communicabant.” l ‘·

And the witty author of Father Prout's Reliques has
certainly achicved a double triumph in this respect, having
given us, in the Eulogy on Prout, and thc lines addressed
