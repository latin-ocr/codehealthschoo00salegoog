All bathings shun soon aster having fed,

But when digestion's done, no bathings dread.
Just fresh from nuptia! rite or bath reirain

From writing, if your sight you would maintain.
F resh srorn the bath to eat is never good,

Nor drink, as experts long have understood.
salt water dries the body very much-

Frrslz, tones it ; that of wells chills by its touch.
In warrn baths never make a lengthy stay,

Lest inner moisture be increased this way.

OUND wine revives iu Age the heart of youth,
While poor wine acts the other way, forsooth.
Pure wine on all reireshment will bestow,
In brain and stomach cause a cheersul glow,
And stagnant currents force anew to flow.
'Twill all depressing, carking gloom remove,
Sharpen the mind and also sight improve;
Quieken the ear and the whole body nourish,
And cause old age with youthsul bloorn to ssourish.
