firmed by letters patent the ancient privileges os its College
os Doctors. Romualdus,¹ writing in 1075, speaks emphati-
cally of the high renown already achicved by Salernum, of
which place he had not only been archbishop, but had also
obtained a wide reputation as a skillsul practitione'r of medi·
cine. 'l'he archives of the Neapolitan kingdom contain the
names ol Salernian physicians osas early a date as 846,
and in whatever way the school is mentioned by mediaeval
writers, it is always spoken os reverentially, because os its
great antiquity. »

The Greeks, who, in the persons os Hippocrates and
Galen, must be considered as the founders of all rational
Medicina, have always maintained a foothold sor their doc-
trines in some of the medical schools os Europe. And to·
day, Montpclicr, the tormer rival and present successoros
Salernum in dogmatism, is perhaps the purest Hippocratic
school in the world. While it is true that the medical
Fathers were translated into Latin as early as the sixth cen-
tury, as appears srom a passage in Cassiodorus,² yet it would
seem that their authority was somewhat rivaled by the more
practical treatises os the Methodists, wh0, for a while at
least, held sway in the schools. The subsequent develop-
ment οἱ medical learning among the Arabians and their
sedulous culture os the Fathers, whose treatises they had
translated and adopted in their seminarieS, revived their
waning authority among those Western nations with whom
Arabian civilization had come into contact. But whether
this orthodoxy in medicine was carried to Salernum hythe
Saracens or not (and their visits, originally os a predatory
nature, do not antedate the middle of the ninth century), ¹
