EW wine at once doth diuretic prove,

And sluggish boweis tends to sreely move 3
The spleen and liver causes to congest; .
And sometimes too, incites a lithic pest.

110 water drinks at meals hath mischies
breived;
The stomach chilled voids undigested food.

(addition n. v.)

Let men drink wine, let beasts sor fountains orave,
But water-drinking never men enslave.

(addition srom Paris Ed„ 1861.)

If very thirsty, drink just what you need,

Lest thirst should some consuming sever breed;
Nor stint yourselfi but take enough, no more:

So speaks in every age majestic lore.

Yet too much water drunk the iood disturbs

The stomach freis, and thus digestion curbs

’Mid summer heatS, should you desire to drink
From sountain cool, you need not trembling shrink.
Rain water is by fur the best potation,

And gives our jadcd spirits exaltation.
