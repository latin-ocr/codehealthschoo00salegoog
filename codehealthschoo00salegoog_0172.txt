IX hours os sleep suffice ior sire and son, ,
Seven hours wc grant to sioth, an eighth to none;
In less than sevon bc ah thy slecping done.
ls nine arc needed, take not thou a tenth;
Consornr thy sleep to night's appointed length.
Shouid health demand, honr morning take a third;
Better that one hom bed all day ne'er stirred,
Than rob his limbs of their accustomed rest ;
And sor such sleep the morning hour is best
Sleep indue measure profits every one,
' But through excess much ill is osten done.
Nothing is worse than on the back to lie;
While prone relieves a cough, yet hurts the eye.
’Tis well to change from side to side at night, '
And, naught forbidding, choose at first the right.
Upon this side begin thy night's repose‚
And on the lest let sleep her season close.

T least six timei in every fleeting day,
Some tribute to the renal iunction pay,
And twice or thrice ali alvine calls obey,
Nor pause should e'en the King pass by that way.
For usage old asserts that 'tis no shame
'l'o yieid to Nature, whatsoe'er her claim.
