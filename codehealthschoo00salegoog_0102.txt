On tlte Preservatr'on os Healtlr. 9 3

For, as Hippocrates doth truly show,
Diseases sad from all such changes llow. κ

Α stated diet, as it is well known,

Ol physic is the strongest corner-stone.

tty means ol which, if you cau naught impart,
Reliel or cure, vain is your Healing Art.

tut mittini.

OCTORS should thus their patient’s lood revise-

errrt is it? eren the meal? And what its sire?
How osuit? ll'luru? lest, by some sad mistake,
Ill-sorted things should meet and trouble make.¹

tut waltare. Α

ΙΝ cabbage we strange contradictions find3

Its brotlr will loose, its leaves in contrast bind.
But broth aud leaves, when used together, prove
A laxativo, and thus the bowels move. ’

¹Horace, though not a physician, wrote long before the Salernian
masters these memorable words:

“ At simul assis
Miscueris elixa, simul conchylia turdls3
Dulcia se in bilem vertent, stomachoque tumultum
Lenta leret pituita. Vides ut pallidus omnis
Coena desurgat dubia'’—SAT: lib: 2, 2 r 76.
