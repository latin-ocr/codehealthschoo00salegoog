ΕΤ doctors call in clothing fine arrayed,
With sparlding jewels on their hands displayed;
And, il their means allow, let there be had,
To ride, a showy, rich-attircd pad. ’
For when well dressed and looking over-nice,
You may presume to charge a higher price,
Since patients always pay those doctors best,
Who make their calls in {inest clothing dressed,
While such as go about iri simple frieze,
Must put up with the meancst grade os ices;
For thus it is poor doctors everywhere,
Get but the smallest pittance sor their share.

Monk, barber, Jeiv, comediam or old maid,

Soap-boiler he, or pompous alchemist,

Bath-keeper, longer, or poor oculist,

Birthas his name among wise Doctors placed,

And thus through greed the Healing Art's disgraeed.

And skillsul thus describes its proper part.
All ereatures to their end are hurried on,
Live brieily, die, return to earth anon;
