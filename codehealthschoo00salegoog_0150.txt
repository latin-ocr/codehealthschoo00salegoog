Appendix. 141

For an old pledge is a good bonci ’twixt friends,
Until collected,when all sriendship ends.

Let doctors, then, while sick men groan and whine,
Demand that they some legal pledge assign,

For when their pangs and susf’rings all are flown,
O'er pledges given they will curse and groan.
Then always ask the patient lor thy see,

Ere yet lrorn danger he is saved and sree;

Since, when released frorn lell disease’s claw,
None puy the doctor till compelled by law.
Hence, 'tis that every costly drug is thought
Much better ol, for being richly bought;

While srorn all skill which gratis we bestow,

No nselulncss is ever deerned to llow.

Things pay lor things, words puy lor words in kind;
For vain words give the cheapest herbs you lind.
For high sees give such precious drugs as are,
The costly compounds ol the species-son

Let doctorS, then, ol whatsoever school,
Renrernbcr to observe this prudent rule:

When tortured patients cry out, Olt, deor me!
Then let each say, I’ll thank you for my see. .
Yes, pay; discharge the obligation now,

Ere likerhe rest the thing you disuvow.

Men lreed lrorn pain, wc find, too soon surget·
How much to faithful doctors they'rc in debt.

lle sure to ask your pay, while lasts the pain,

Or else at law a suit you must maintain3

nod the recovered man, indignant, will

lixclairn: I've pald, truz'ce paid, tlu's costly bill.
