On tlte Prcservation of Healtlz. 115

...-.

'l'hcn mod'rate homage paid to Love‚ will bring
Α soloce sweet to every living thing.

Lct purgings, baths and perspiration be,

With exercise and medication, free.

For dty is summer with its wontcd lieat,

And chiefly we must study then to meet

The fiery bile, and quell it in its seat.

lle cooling dislics used-be love denied ;

Baths and blood-letting, put them both aside,
And rest to temp’rate living be allied.

Os teeth, in number, thirty-two contains,
With full three-hundred·five-and-sixty veins.

OUR hnmors form the body in this style,

Atrabilisfl Blood‚ Phlegm and yellow Bile.
With earth atrabilis may well compare,
Consuming lire with bile, and blood with air.
