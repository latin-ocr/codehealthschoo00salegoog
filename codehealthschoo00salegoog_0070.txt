Or tlte l’reservation of Healtlr. 61

From beer gross humors and great strength will start,
And sizy blood be formed in every part.

It spurs the reins and flesh augments in all,

The bowels lrees and e’en distends withal.

Vincgar cools, yet chielly dries the blood,

The body wastes-a melancholy llood

Ol ills begetS, and procreation chills‚

While nerves aud flesh it withers and distills. ’

LENDER in Spring thy diet be, and spare;
Disease, in Summer, springs srom surplus iare.

From Autumn fruits be caresul to abstain,
Lest by mischance they should occasion pain.
But when rapacious Winter has come on,
Then sreely eat till appetite is gone.

F all the cunning draughts that you can bren,
The best is Sage, combined with grncesul Rue.
Let rose-leaves be into this mixture brought,
And love's desires will quickly come to naught.
