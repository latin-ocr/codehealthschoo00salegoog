Introductory.

‘⁴ Use joyous scasts, with cheerlul friends unite,
Whom qnips and cranks and pointed jokes dclight.
What mortal lives to whom enchanting songs
llring not consoling joys, in clust'ring throngs?

’l'o him, whose nature ne’er is moved by these,

Will pangs ol henrt leave little wortdty cnse.

For naoght does human breast so much rejoice,

As melody from Music's dulcet voicc

Strike but the harp-black Care, dethroned, will fly,
And goldcn Joy instead, thine heart list high”

Again, and as germane to the same subject, we quote
the following verses from Jerome F racastorius.

‘⁴ Fly thou sad things. which loatl the tendet heart,
Bid pallid sear and every care depart.
Lct vcngelul hate, great source ol all distress,
Give place in turn to perfect happiness
Lct cholcest lood and joyons wine delight,
And leasts where plenty reigns at kingly height
View cities and survey the country’s tremore,
And let it ever be supremest pleasure
To wander where, with fascinating mich,
Tempe's sair groves and glitt’ring streams are seen.
Or, mastering some lordly mountain high,
Gnin puter brcezes stom the morning sky.
But where’er placed¹ amid what charms, forsooth,
Be there at hand a choir oi maida and youtb.”

Which idea is eloquently expressed by Ovid, Book 1.,
Epist. 4, as follows:

‘'Deprived ol rost, all prematutely die,
'Tis this alone that doth our strength supply.”
