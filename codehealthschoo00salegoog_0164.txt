Eat spice and honey, ginger‚ too-drink mead.

' ARM things employ in cold December‘s reign ;
. Cabbnge avoid; bleed from the temple’s vein.
Shun bnths, bnt letali sood thnt's ratcd dear,
Like wine nnrl pirensnnts, sorni thy dain chccr.
From drnnghts os nir let thy head guarded bc,

And sor health’s sake drink only cassia tea.

ITHOUT the habit, suppers never suit;
Shun then strange ments and drinks and fish
and fruit.
And frequent reneis, of disease the root.
Take wine sor health’s sake aster every course,

And those who can let them this rule enforce.
Drink not when needless; eat not out oi m00d;

» For thirst and hunger tonic powers include,

While surseits bring os direst ills a brood,
Note roten you drink, that you may not sall ill,
Note nitar you drink; drink nster baths your fill.
