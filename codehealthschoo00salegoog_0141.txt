“The puisante Kinge of Brittannye
The schole of famous memorye,

- Salernum, biddes him selse to statne,
Is healthe he woulde and kepe the same ;
Geve cares noe place within thy brest;
Lett stetting furies be supprest;

Τοο muche os wine use not to swill;
Suppe you but lighte, eate not thy fill;
At meate to sitte soe longe a time,

To rise is not soe greate a crime3

At noone geve not thye selfe to slepe;
Nor use thye water forto kepe.

“He maye that liste this to observe‚
Him selse longe time in healthe preserve.
, When physicke harde is to be hadd,
Three things may be in steede.
The minde in noe wise must be sadde,
Meane reste and dictte muste thee feede.'’
