(Addicton from Paris Ed„ 1861.)

Black bile o'er bodies its dark color throws,
And in its grasp each mortal dusky grows
These last are thiu, the sanguine stout and tall;
Let those dread tabes-surseits, these appel.

Iuorcrirrous os Promoti.

Plethora’s faceis os a ssorid shade,
Her eyeballs large and very glaring made;

While cheeks and sorm with mass are overlaid. ¹
The pulse is quiek, full, sost; there’s frontal pain,

Anduurst,1ewd dreamS, and constipation reign,
While ssuids bland to aeid turn uruaiu.

Iun1chr1ousor Excsss or Bur.

Pain os right side and loaded tongue show bile,
Vomitings, vigils, ears that ring a while.

Thirst, nausea, loosenesS, colic's painsul smart3

Poor appetite and biting cramps oi heart.

The pulse, though light, doth bound with fev’rish start.
Biie spreads throughout its bitter taste of gali,

BurnS, and gives rise to fiery dreams 'in all.

Iuorchrrous or Exesss or theu.

Excess of phlegm disturbs a healthy state,

Harms taste, gives loathirrgs, tends to salivate.
Gives pain os stomaeh‚ ribs and back os head;
The pulse is rare and sost, its strength all fied,

And wat'ry dreams by artsul sleep are bred.
