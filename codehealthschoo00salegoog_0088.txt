So, il in perfect health thou wouldest be,

Drink little wine and sar [τοττι Venus flee.

Herbs spring [τοττι showers, and pointed words from
wine,

While knowledge springs alone [τοττι thought's deep
mine.

Yet, beast-like, many mortals daily perish,

Clinging to sloth with an undying relish.

F lowers yield to fruits, and joys to sorrows pale;

When hoarse, then like the goose, drink Adam’s ale.

Penes should be followed by deep draughts or

The nut lor poison is a balsam line.
Though plenty, pears are, without wine, a bane ς
And il so, eursed be pear-trees and profane!
When cooked, all kinds ol poison they expel,
But raw, are in themselves a poison fell,
That loads and gnaws the stomach with lierce pain ;
While eooked, such torments they expel amain.
Then follow this, as a most useful rule—
Drink aller pears srorn apples go to stool.

Pears bind, preceding lood3 purge when they follow ;
Then, aster pearS, os good wine take a swallow.
