T menls to sipping only, cling personne,
And sor health’s sake drink not between each
course.

(Addition n. v.)

Would you no peptic torments ever feel?

With drink, instead ns fond, begin each mea13
Nuts always add to fish; to ments add cheese;
One nnt is good3 another brings disease;

A third with death’s own fangs mankind will seize.¹
And als0, aster every egg you swallow,

Let instantly a fresh potation follow.

(Additzbn stom Paris Ed„ 1861.)

Old wine is apt to burn and desiccnte,

Make bile, and e’en, 'tis said, to constipate ;
But, sparingly diluted, quickly gives

Fair sustenance to everything that lives.

By sipping merely, osten it corrects

of heavy meals the dolorous effects;

And thus may Bacchus, when he’s fitly w00ed,
In point os worth stand close nllied to sood;
But wine, when drngged‚ to leprosy gives rise,
And to be used, needs water as a guise.

¹ The first nnt is, hy Vina Nova, supposed to he the melmeg, the second ¹
the walum, and the third the vomit-nm.
