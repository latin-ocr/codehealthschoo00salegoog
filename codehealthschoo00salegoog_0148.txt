Were doctors skilled enough to undermine
Each scll disease, they'd almost be divine. -
But, as all practice showS, no doctor can

Make lise anew, though he may stretch its span.
Nature this power most jealously reserves-
Alone the body heals and lise preserveS.

HE dish which first the doctor’s advent greetS,
Holds what his patient morbidly excreteS.
Dropsy and stubborn quartans on their part,
Are gloring scandals to the Hcaling Art.

Ι NOWLEDGE not gratis comcs, Nor without sees,
On sich men, would attend Hippocrates.

When nny doctor first attends a call,

The patient would bestow the world and all;

But once relieved and salely out of bed,

The doctor’s aid from memory has flod.

nnd most os oll is hc should darc to ask

Reward or pledge due lor his thankless task.

Three laces wears the doctor: when first sought,
nn nngel's ; and a god's, the cure hals wrought3
But when, that cure complete, he seeks his see,
The De'il looks then less terrible than he.
