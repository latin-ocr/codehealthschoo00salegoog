MEDIUM-SIZED incision always make,
Whate’er amount ol blood you wish to take;
The copious vapor rising sudden, fleeS,

Aud thus the blood escapes with greater ease.

HEN one is bled he should for lull six hours
Most vigilant maintaln his mental power3‚

Lcst sumes of artlul slumber too prosound
Should all his mortal nature sadly wound.
For sear that thou some slender nerve shouldst mar, ·
Conduct not the incislou deep nor sar3
And being purgcd through blood, and thus renewed‚
Haste notat once to sate thysell with lood.
