On tte preservation ff Healtlt. 117

(Addam A. v.)

Blood is moist‚ wann, and vital as the air;

While phlegm is cold, through water's copious share;
Bile burns like fite, where'cr it ssows along3

Gall, ‹hy and cool, to earth bears likencss strong.

UCH are by nature stout, and sprightly too,
And ever searching aster gossip new. ⁴
Lovc VcnuS, Bacchus banquets, noisy joy,
And jovial, they kind words alone employ;
In studies apt-pre-eminent in arts,
No wrath srom any cause e’er moves their hearts.
Gay, loving, cheersul and profuse in all,
Hearty, tuneful, wherever sate may call;
They’rc florid, bold, and yet benign withal.

ITH headstrong people yellow bile sorts well,
For such men would in everything excel.
They lcarn with ease-eat much and grow apace,
Are great, profuse, and avid os high place.
Hairy, bold, wrathsul, crasty, lavish, shrewd,
Their form is lithe, complexion safsron-ltued.
