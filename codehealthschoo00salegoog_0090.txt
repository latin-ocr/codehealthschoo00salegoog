When cooked, both sood and uselul physic prove.

The peel removed, the pulp you then may eat,
Though peach and these, unpeeled, are iar more sweet.

The blood throughout in healthy tone augment.

RUNES cool the body and the bowels move-
To all, in many ways, a blessing prove.

For they, in proper order well combine.
