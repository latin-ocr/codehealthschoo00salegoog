12 Preface.

Regimen Sam'tatis Salamias awork of transcendent merit.
''lhough written in the early twilight os the Middle Ages
and in inferior Latin, it at once took its place alongside os
such classic productione as the Aphorisms of Hippocrates.
No secular work, indeed, ever met with more popular favor,
nor insused its canons so radically into the dogmas of any .
science. It was for ages the medical Bible of all Western 't
Europe, and held undisputed sway over the teachings oi its
schools‚ next to the writings of Hippocrates and Galen. ³
For centuries, the educated world, laymen, as well as phy· ¹
siciens, pondered over its broad truths, its quaint sugges·

its aphoristic sayings, as the hoarded wisdom ol all pre-
ceding time. And though its merit is not enhanced by the
framework of Leonine verses in which the subject was set,
it would be unjust to suppose that even this masculine, un-
varnished measure, without any quality to recommend it
save its sonorous cadences‚ had no part in introducing it to
popular lavor. Little wonderis it, therefore, that it became
a Book of Proverbs among physicians, asort os Wale Mecum
in fact, which, down even to modern days, each one felt
bound to commit to memory, as Cicero tells us Roman
boys did the Twelve Tables, ut carrarca necessarium. To
such a celebrity had this Poem attained even to the present
century, that it has passed through, as one critic asserts,
two hundred and sorty editions, while others say only one
hundred and sixty-three. Be this as it may, either ligure
expresses a popularity not commonly acquired by any
secular work.

With such a record to introduce it, little need be said in
explanation os its reappearance, beyond what was stated in
the opening sentence of this presace. 'l'he Poem-how-
ever barbarous its Latin, however limping in structure and

, faulty in syntax, as well as¹ prosody-will always speak for
