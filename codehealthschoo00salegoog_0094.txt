HOUGH eating turnips may impart delight,

’Tis known that they much ssatulence excite.
They spoil the teeth-thcy also spur the reinS,
And when ill-cooked cause most tormenting pains.

(Addzxion A. v.)

Its root is good, and gives us blessings three-
Purges‚ and aids the sight, andwind sets sree.
And yet on turnips is you daily seed,

You‘ll reap os wind a most prodigious meed.
