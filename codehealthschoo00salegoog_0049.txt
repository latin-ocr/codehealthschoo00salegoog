in the opening apostrophe to the Duke of Normandy.¹
These were the great pivots around which all ancient thera-
peutics turned. They were considered to be the pillars of
‚successful medical practice, without which, in fact, no
treatment could be said to have any foundation in the laws
of nature. And viewing, through the lapse of centuries,
the importance paid by the Medical Fathers to Hygiene as
a co-operative science to Medicine and the chief fountain
of those collateral aids and compensations which enabled
them, with so much less knowledge than we possess, to
eope successfully with disease, it may be seriously ques·
tioned whether we moderas give attention enough to this
department of sanitary science in actual'nredical practice,
or make it, as generally as we should, an integral part of a
medical education. The best essays of Hippocrates and
Galen are upon Hygiene-essays which may still be read
and followed with profit, for they are applicable to all
times and places, and all conditions of mankind.
Commenting in detail upon theru, Arnold of Villa Nova
expounds tous in a graceful and lucid style thc correspond-
ing ideas of the great masters, whether Greek or Arabian,
concerning these topics‚ and, like a true philosopher,
believed in asystem of Hygiene which regarded the body
as essentially under the dominion of conservative lawe-vis
medicatr'ix natura—which laws were constantly striving to
re-establish their authority when dethroned, sua merite, and

¹ Many of the descriptions, if not most, of the therapeutic virtues of
herbs mentioned in the text are evidently borrowed froin a poem enti-
tled “De Wrtutr'bws laruarum? written by a physician named Odobonns,
who, singularly enough, wrote under the name of AEmilius Macer, a
Roman poet of the days of the Republic, to whom a poem, similarly

named, is credited, although nothing of it has been preserved, except
an occasional fugitive line (Vid. Mattaire). Vid. Odobonus, in Fabricius,

nib: Lata Med. et Infima Aetatis: lib: xiv, p. 468, and similarly,
Macer, lib: xii.. p. 3.
