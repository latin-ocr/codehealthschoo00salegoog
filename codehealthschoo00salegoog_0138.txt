illitum tn ue fluuium after luuntur. -

LL things from milk as are in gen’ral made,
And drauglrts ol wine, ol' whatsocver grade,
Should every one dismissed, avoided be
By recent subjects ol phlebotomy.
Cold things are also hurtsul to the weak,
Nor let them, dauntless, brave damp skies or bleak;
For vigor only comes once more to these
From sunshine nringled with the passing breeze.
To all rest proves an everlasting gain,
While exercise occasions certain pain.

ln tunm iutuemur, unns aut duantum lulum
lutum sunrut attur.

CUTE disease, or only so in part,

Demands blood-letting sreely from the start. ι
In middle age, bleed largely without sear,
. But trent old age like tendor clrildhood here.
In spring you may bleed doubly at your pleasure-
At other times alone in single measure.

⁵ detinui ilaus ute tp ue luculum anu ut tuhut
cunnus.

IN spring, and likewise in the summer tide,

Blood should be drawn alone from the right side.
