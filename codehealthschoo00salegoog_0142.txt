On the Preservntion os Hcaltlr. 133

The second mlled the Enotrsnunu's Ductori, London‚ A. D. 1607:

“The Salerne Schoole rioth by these lines impart
All hualth to iingland's King, and doth advise
From care his head to keepe, horn wrath his hatte.
Drink not much wine, sup light, and soone arise.
When meat is gone long sitting breedeth smart ;
And aster noone still waking keepe your eies,
When mou'd you find your selse to nature's need,
F orbeare thern not, for that much danger breeds,
Use three physitians still—first Dr. Quiet,

Next Dr. Merry-mau, and Dr. Dyet.”

The third called the Rnurnuur or Harum, London 1617:

⁸‘ nn Salerne Schoole thus writes to England's King,
And sor nren's health these frt advises bring.
Shunne busie cares, rash angers, which displease 3
Light supping, little drinke doe cause great ease.
Rise aster mente, sleepe not at asternoone,
Utine and nature's neede, expell them suone.
Long shalt thou live is all. these well be done.
When physieke needes, let these thy doctors be,

Good diet, quiet thoughts, heart mirthsul, free.”
