ao Introductory.

all writers agree upon the lact that her early, constant and
uncompromising conservatism had, lrorn the lirst, won her
the distinguished title os Crvrrns Hirrocnrncr,¹ a title os
which she was herself justly proud, since this legend was
inscribed upon her seal.

But although an enemy to Empiricism and Methodism,
either os which crceds had been considered as essentially

practice was guided by a rational interpretation ol the

any consciousness os the opposite character os the two
systems, the former of which they would have been horri-

ever, in this connection, to discuss iu detail the peculiar
tenets os this renowned school. They may have been

purely Hippocratic, or partly Themisonion. They may
