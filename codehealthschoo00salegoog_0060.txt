On the Preservatthn of Healtlt. 51

(Additthn stom Paris Ed. os 1861.)

Perchance, should some one crave a midday nap
From habit-then, t’will cause him less mishap.

But let nono sleop soon after having sed,

Nor long, and always with uplisted head.

To point these mles, t’is fitting to rehearse‚

To him who slccps, this rude, untutored verse: ’
Post-prandia! slccp, ye mortulo, put asar,

In any month whose name includes an R. ⁵
Post-prandial slcop ’s alone salubrious,

In months, whose n'ames their ending have in US.-

Wouldst lightly rest? curtail thine evening sare.
