Appenrlr‘x. 167

Shun mournsul thoughts, each fleeting pleasure seize ;
Let garments rare thy fancy daily please.

May some dear maid her gen'rous love bestow‚

To make thy heart with kindred passion glow.

The choicest sood and dainty cups prepare,

Yet shun excess and glutton's luscious sare ;

And study evcr to direct thy lise

In pleasant paths, and sar removed from strise.

vultuatum.

HE Flower os Physic endeth here its strain3
The Author‚ happy o'er his garnered grain, .
Prays that in Hcaven there be prepared sor him,
A seat near Christ, and His blest Seraphim.

Amen!
