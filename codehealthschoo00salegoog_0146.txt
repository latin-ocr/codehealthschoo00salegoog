ROM laws of health and siekness leam disease3
Who studies lise, her laws more wisely sees. ’
The greatest duty of the Healing Art
Is first to know whence all diseases start.
A skilled physician will be always sure
To read disease, and somehow work a cure.
A doctor. in whatever patient’s case,
Has many blind and knotty points to face3
As heat of parts, their posture and their form,
Disease, the patient’s strength to breast its storm. Ι
He must change solids, check a growing tumor,
And swellings solten into transient humor ;
Or liqucsy deposits quickly growing,
And turn them all into some matter flowing.
