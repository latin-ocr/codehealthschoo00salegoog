in advance of all human intervention in their behalf 3 and
looking to this as the keystone in the arch of Medical prac-

own views. With the modesty of a great mind, he, al·
though among the greatest of his century, never offends
by any dogmatic assertion of his own views, but always
places them behind those of RhazeS, Avicenna, Averroes,
Galen, ete. In this respect his commentary is strikingly
impersonal, although in itself a ¹fine specimen of didactie

composition. And its Latinity is so far in advance of that “

of the Poem itself, as to afford a striking evidence of the
contrast between the productions of lettered and uniet·
tered men in the same field of professional composition.
The following is a specimen. speaking of cheerfulnesS,
he thus expresses himself:

⁴‘ Laetitia enirn calorem excitat naturalem, spiritus tem-
perat, et putiores reddit, virtutem corroborat, aetatem flori·
dam facit, juvenile corpus dih conservat, vitam prorogat,
ingenium acuit et hominem negotiis quibuslibet obeundis
aptiorem reddit. Huiusmodi porrb sunt cibi suaves et
hona succi, vinum subtile ac delectabile, boni et fragrantes ’
odoreS, delectabilium rerum commemoratio, et cum amicis ’
et familiaribus frequentior et jucunda conversatio. Quare
ut Eobanus noster diserte canens admonet.’'¹ ⁸

scholare know, style is untranslatable, and, desiring to give a specimen
of Villa Nova’s, f could only do it, therefore, in the original.
