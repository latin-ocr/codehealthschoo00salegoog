‘Tis heavy, not light, suppers that give pain,

As common sense and doctors both maintain.
Uuless compelied, you never should combine,
At one mezu, divers sorts oi sood or wine;

hut is coustrairred, then take the lightest cheer;
From wine arui milk a lepra will appear.
Routine before arrd aster meals demands

Water, dispenset! to wash convivial hands,
With wholesome dishes be all paupers sed;

Let supper close our calis sor daily bread.

Curb appetite and thus prolong your brenth-
Temp’rance, the doctors tell us, laughs at death.

EGIN with nreats, with coffee then conclude;
Eschew such drinks as toper hands have brewed‚
Which burn our ssesh, yet palate ali deiude.
Be bread the {ast oi anythiug you eat,
And aster meais shun sires that give much hear„
But supper over, then your time beguile
With rest, or geutly stroliing ior auriie.

And wines and liquors armed with fiery glow.
Partahe of them as ost as you prefer,

And health and sscsh on you they will confer,
