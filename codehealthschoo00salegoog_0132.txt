Whene’er this dreggy humor doth invade,

The pulse is hard, the renai stream delayed,

The skin throughout assumes a dusky shade.
Gloom'reignS, and sear and dreams os darkest hue,
And aeid belchings, taste and spit, ensue.

The lightest sound borne on the atmosphere,
Whistlings and ringings causes in the ear.

RE seveuteen years we scaree need drawing blood;
lligh spirits sall hy tapping lise’s own flood.
Wine may restore a wonted, joyous mood,
But loss os blood is late repaired by sood.
Bleeding the body purges in disguise,
For it excites the nerves, improves the eyes
And mind, and gives the bowels exercise.
Brings sleep, clear thoughts, and sadness drives away,
Anu hearing, strength and voice augments each day.

ALLED lunar, are September, April, May,
Because they move beneath the Hydra's¹ sway.

¹ The constellation Hydra, or the Wrier Serpent, was, in ancient As-
tronomy, supposed to exereise a controlling influence over the pheses
of the moon.
