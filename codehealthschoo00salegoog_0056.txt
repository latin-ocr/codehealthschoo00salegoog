ALERNO'S SCHOOL, in conclave high, unites
‘l'o counscl Euomun's ch, and thus indites:

If thou to luealth and vigor wouldst anain,
Shun welghty cares—all anger deem profane,
From heavy suppcrs and much wine abstain'
Nor tribial count it, nster pompous sare,

‘To riso from table and to take the air.

Sllun idle, noonday slumber, nor delay

The urgent calls os Nature to obey.

These rulcs is thou wilt follow to tlte end,
Thy lise to greater length thou mayst extend*

. (Addam Λ.ν.’)
Shouldst Doctors need Ρ be these in Doctors' steati—
Rest, cheersulness, and table thinly-spread.
